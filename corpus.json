This movie, like writer/director Roland Emmerich’s other efforts (“Day After Tomorrow,” “Godzilla,” “Stargate”), is really not the most riveting or complex you’ll ever see. Also, the acting leaves something to be desired, but nobody can say it’s not entertaining. And really ... how many actors can convincingly portray a caveman romance, anyway? Them are big rawhide slippers to fill.",

Apple took the opportunity toupdatethe classic hard disk drive for the Macintosh HD icon to one that more accurately resembles the solid state drives used in modern Macs. However, Mac users took issue with a few details. First, the perspective of the Apple logo and the drive angle didn’t make much sense. Second, the drive icon also featured a random port and holes. It’s as terrible as the original version. Apple seems to have taken that feedbackto heart with the new Macintosh HD icon in macOS 26.1 Tahoe.",

It became statistically certain Friday night when Joki got his fourth assist of Denver’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies. That assist was his 700th of the season, assuring him of averaging no worse than 10.0 assists for 70 games. The other players to average a triple-double for a full season: Russell Westbrook, Joki’s current Denver teammate, and Basketball Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson. Westbrook did it four times — 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 for Oklahoma City, as well as in 2020-21 for Washington — and Robertson did it in the 1961-62 season for Cincinnati.",

    "texto": "\"Escape from Cluster Prime\" is the main reason for the show's cancellation. I believe that the 44-minute special \"Escape from Cluster Prime\" is the main reason for the show's cancellation. Here's why: Nora's Out-of-Character Behavior:In the first and second seasons, we see Nora Wakeman, Jenny's creator, evolve from treating Jenny like her other robot creations to genuinely bonding with her and seeing her as a daughter. However, in \"Escape from Cluster Prime,\" Nora is portrayed as being out of character. She reverts to seeing Jenny primarily as a world-saving robot and expresses frustration and disappointment in her for being reckless during her duties, despite Jenny's success. This regression in their relationship dynamic felt jarring and inconsistent with the development we had seen up to that point.",

Johnson has been a member of the Packers since 1990, and Johnson's defenses are largely based on Johnson's testimony. Johnson has also been charged with a count of obstruction of justice, which he says was a violation of the NFL's \"priority\" rule.

Johnson's defense attorneys said Johnson was the only defendant. Johnson's defense attorney, however, says Johnson \"did not deserve the blame.\" Johnson's defense attorneys said Johnson had not tried to do anything wrong and would have been a \"senior\" judge.

Given the American influence on the island (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory), you’ll also hear the locals speaking what is affectionately known as “Spanglish,” a mix of English and Spanish. Puerto Rico is arguably the easiest Caribbean island to enjoy. There are nearly 1,000 direct flights to the island each week from the U.S., and there are countless gorgeous resorts and villas for you to enjoy as you explore the island’s rich culture. Americans don’t need a passport when traveling to this Caribbean escape. Puerto Rico is well known for itsworld-class rum, the famous Plaza Las Américas shopping center, which is the largest in the Caribbean, and its white-sand beaches.",
